								<p>The greatest purpose of marriage is to reveal the covenant relationship between
									Christ and church’ has struck with me. This means that you cannot give up on
									marriage
									in challenging situations, but must work on it. When we forgive our spouse, we are
									not
									actually expecting perfection, but giving them room to grow!
									Recently there was an argument with my husband, and I was feeling quite angry. I had
									to remind myself this point- “relax this is against somebody else (evil one), not
									against him”.
									quickly I could sense that change where I didn’t burst out in hatred/anger. I could
									experience
									God saving me from myself from bursting out or harboring that hatred towards my
									husband

								<p> I started this training during lockdown, thinking that I will keep myself occupied.
									But it turned out that as I did the first module it had such a deep impact on my
									life that I decided to complete the course. The fourth module helped me to identify
									the pattern I was following in my marriage, especially in the area of communication.
									I admitt that I manipulate my husband for my selfish purposes. I was able to see my
									folly and realize that self-love motivated me to behave so. Also, in the area of
									parenting, I approach children via shaming, threatening, bribing, and comparing
									them. So far, I used to consider it normal as this is the pattern I was also raised,
									and nobody taught that this is not a godly way of parenting. I thank God for opening
									my eyes. I am trying to apply the new ways of living in my family life.

								<p>This course has been a blessing for me. I come from a dysfunctional family, my dad
									was an
									alcoholic, and I had an expectation that my husband would shower all the love that
									my
									father did not give to me in my childhood. I entered marriage with a sense of
									entitlement. The first chapter hit me hard, in my marriage the foundation was far
									from love and grace. I had brushed many things in my marriage- I used to feel that
									he should change not just me, I have already done enough.
									I learned that sense of entitlement is a sin in God’s sight, I had applied
									confession in different areas of my life except my marriage. I used to think that
									both people must change simultaneously beginning with my husband and then me. I will
									change after he changes, and God must change my husband first and then change me. I
									realized that I was wrong. Earlier when I was single, I used to blame my mother for
									my behavior but now in marriage I don’t have anyone to blame (other than myself). I
									can see the idols in my heart through this course
